# 🩻 RBYRCT: Reconstructing CT Smarter, Faster, Safer

Patent-pending (Ray-by-Ray Computed Tomography) **RBYRCT reconstruction technology** for next-gen CT — designed to accelerate the fight against breast cancer with GPU-optimized iterative reconstruction.

Breast cancer screening saves lives, but today’s CT scans require **high radiation doses** to get clear images. That dose can be risky, especially for younger patients. Our technology, **RBYRCT**, is designed to **cut radiation dose without losing detail** - potentially transforming how cancers are caught early.

## What we built

This project combines two worlds:

* **MART (Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction Technique)** — an advanced algorithm that can reconstruct good images even from sparse or noisy CT data.
* **GPU Acceleration with NVIDIA CUDA** — MART is powerful but slow on CPUs. With NVIDIA GPUs, it becomes *10–100× faster*, making it practical in real-time.

## The core idea

Think of CT like taking **many X-ray “shadows”** of an object from different angles, then piecing them together.

* The **old way (FBP, Filtered Back Projection)** is fast but needs a *lot* of X-rays (higher dose).
* Our way (**RBYRCT MART on GPUs**) can do the same job (or better) with fewer X-rays (lower dose) — meaning *less radiation for patients*.

## Results at a glance

* ⚡ **Speed**: GPU MART runs in milliseconds vs. seconds for CPU.
* 🩻 **Image quality**: Cleaner reconstructions in sparse-angle, noisy settings.
* 🌍 **Impact**: Aiming for **earlier, safer breast cancer detection worldwide**.

## Usage

### Run Benchmarks

Run the grid benchmark and auto-save results to `assets/`:

```bash
make bench
```

Outputs:

* `assets/bench_grid.csv` – raw runtime/metrics data
* `assets/bench_table.md` – Markdown summary (drop directly into slides/docs)
* `assets/runtime_vs_size.png` – runtime scaling plot

### Launch Demo

Interactive app for MART vs FBP side-by-side reconstruction:

```bash
make demo
```

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Formatting & Linting

```bash
make format   # black
make lint     # flake8
```

### Troubleshooting
- **No GPU?** Runs CPU-only automatically. Set `RBYRCT_FORCE_CPU=1` to force CPU.
- **Colab GPU mismatch (cudaErrorInsufficientDriver)?** 
  `pip uninstall -y cupy* && pip install cupy-cuda12x` (or `11x` if `nvidia-smi` shows 11.x), then Runtime → Restart.
- **Import error?** We set `PYTHONPATH` in the notebook; no editable install needed.
