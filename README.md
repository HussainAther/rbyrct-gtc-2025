# RBYRCT-GTC-2025

Patent-pending **RBYRCT reconstruction technology** for next-gen CT — designed to accelerate the fight against breast cancer with GPU-optimized iterative reconstruction.

---

## Features
- 🚀 **GPU-accelerated MART** (Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction Technique)
- 🖥️ **CPU FBP baseline** for comparisons
- 📊 Built-in benchmarking + metrics (PSNR, SSIM)
- 🎛️ Interactive **Streamlit demo** (`demo/app.py`)
- 🧪 Easy testing & reproducibility (`pytest`, `Makefile`)

---

## Installation

Clone the repo and install in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rbyrct-gtc-2025.git
cd rbyrct-gtc-2025
python -m pip install -e .
````

Requirements are in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).
GPU features require **NVIDIA GPU + CuPy**.

---

## Usage

### Run Benchmarks

Run the grid benchmark and auto-save results to `assets/`:

```bash
make bench
```

Outputs:

* `assets/bench_grid.csv` – raw runtime/metrics data
* `assets/bench_table.md` – Markdown summary (drop directly into slides/docs)
* `assets/runtime_vs_size.png` – runtime scaling plot

### Launch Demo

Interactive app for MART vs FBP side-by-side reconstruction:

```bash
make demo
```

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Formatting & Linting

```bash
make format   # black
make lint     # flake8
```

## Results

Below is an example benchmark run (automatically generated by `make bench`):
